General Assembly SEI 22 - Project #4 - August 2019
  * Heroku: https://project-4-fml.herokuapp.com/
  * Github: https://github.com/tcrawls/project-4-fml
  * Project board: https://trello.com/b/w6MDQDM1/project-4-sei22
  

## Overview

My objective for Project 4 was to further develop my programming skills and gain additional experience building a full-stack application using the MERN stack (React, Node/Express and MongoDB/Mongoose). I chose to create a social app that would allow users to create photo "albums," post and share images within these albums (via social cards/posts), and comment on individual posts.

For the current version (version 1), my goal was to build the core functionality that would enable users to add/edit albums, posts and comments, as well as to integrate these key pieces of functionality throughout the user experience. Additionally, I sought to create an application that would be adaptable - i.e. could serve as a "platform" for future skill-building and advanced feature development opportunities as I hone my programming skills (see "Future Development" below).
